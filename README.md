# NodeAutoVersionPush
A Visual Studio Code macro in JavaScript to automate version numbering then committing and pushing.
The numbering is based on date and total commits count.
For example: 2022.3.8-123
It requires installing [VSCode Macros](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EXCEEDSYSTEM.vscode-macros) and [Git Automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit) extensions.

After installing the extensions (follow their instructions) and pulling this repo files, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to VSMacro: User Macro 01.
I'm using Alt+Shift+M
